# Prompt History Record

## Input

```
/sp.plan - set up module-2 in Docusaurus with structured chapters for gazebo & unity simulations (physics, environments, senors). - All content written as .md files, organized  per chapter for easy navigation.
```

## Response

Created comprehensive implementation plan for Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) including:

1. Implementation Plan (plan.md) - Outlining the approach for creating educational content about Gazebo and Unity simulation
2. Research Document (research.md) - Covering technology choices, best practices, and integration patterns
3. Data Model (data-model.md) - Defining the conceptual entities for the simulation module
4. Quickstart Guide (quickstart.md) - Providing setup instructions and first steps
5. API Contracts (contracts/content-api.yaml) - Defining interfaces for the educational content system

The plan is aligned with the feature specification and ready for the next phase of creating tasks for implementation.
